MECHANICS OF THE GAME
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Two players take turns: one is Player X, the other is Player O.
- On a player’s turn, they click on an empty square to place their symbol (X or O).
- The game automatically prevents players from clicking on a cell that’s already filled.
- After each move, the game checks if a player has: Three of their symbols in a row (horizontal), three in a column (vertical), or three diagonally.
- If a player wins, a popup message shows “Player X wins!” or “Player O wins!”.
- If the grid is completely filled and no one wins, the popup will say “It’s a draw!”.
- A New Game button is available to reset the board and start over.
